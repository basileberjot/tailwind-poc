// Tailwind classes can be applied to a MUI component but can't override MUI's styles.

// We can use MUI Base components and style them with Tailwind, but the selection of components is limited and need to be styled from scratch
// I'm also not sure the slotProps covers all the parts of the component we would want to style

// But we can use regular CSS targetting the MUI class (eg: .MuiButtonBase-root) and style that way
// I don't remember why we chose to use CSS in JS to style MUI components on Jupiter and Washi with makeStyles/createStyles or styled API

// Maybe we can have a combination of Tailwind for its convenience while being lightweight, and regular CSS to style MUI components

/*
/* NOTE IF WE NEED TO RE-USE WASHI
*/
// Also, we could use all the CSS in JS we wrote in Washi
// We would need to use conditional classNames when props were being used in styled API (eg: hasValue in MultipleSelect)
